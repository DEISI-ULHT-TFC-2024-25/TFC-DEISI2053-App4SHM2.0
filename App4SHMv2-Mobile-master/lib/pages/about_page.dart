So, the next time you are on a bridge feeling shaken by the passing of a truck, think that the vibration you are feeling belongs solely to that bridge, and that there is no other bridge in the world that would vibrate in the same way. Bridges are like the strings of a guitar: no two strings would play the same sound. App4SHM simply checks if a bridge has gone ‘out of tune’. For that, it uses the accelerometers installed on the mobile phone to measure the accelerations of the bridge under normal operational conditions. The vibration frequencies of the bridge are extracted from the acceleration time series and compared with those measured some time ago to see if the changes suggest damage. Transient changes are probably not indication of damage (perhaps the measurements were made at a rush hour and the mass of the traffic influenced the vibration of the bridge), but sustained and significant changes should be an alarm signal and motivate a detailed inspection of the bridge.",
