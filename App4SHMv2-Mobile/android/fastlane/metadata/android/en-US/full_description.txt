App4SHM is a smartphone application for structural health monitoring (SHM) of bridges or other civil structures to assess their condition after a catastrophic event or when required by authorities and stakeholders. The application interrogates the phoneâ€™s internal accelerometer to measure structural accelerations and applies artificial intelligence techniques to detect damage in almost real time.
